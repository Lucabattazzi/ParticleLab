Changes applied 16/12 Bandini:
    Changed Impulse module bnin number to fix probability of 0.000158
    Created "visualize_v2.cpp", apt to save the canvases and take care of their visuals.
Issues to be discussed together:
    Measurement unit is unspecified yet in impulse and energy histograms
    Impulse fit is too accurate and it covers the histogram
    We need to add a legend to the fit canvas
